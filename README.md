# LoveNotes
Love Notes FullStack App!



## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, express, Node.js

This Love Notes Application was really fun to make! Using Node.js and express was hard at first, as I had gone through many simple errors that crashed my server.

## How I feel after

I completed the challenge: 5
I feel good about my code: 4
I think that the end product came out really well! Usually I struggle with css, but I think it has a nice simple look. Some things that I want to work on is the functionality of my trash and heart buttons when opperating with my full stack.
